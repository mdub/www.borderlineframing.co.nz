      “Borderline Framing has undertaken framing for several of my recent shows of photography. The high quality of the framing has never faltered, and the work has always been done on time and within budget. This is the best priced quality framing I have been lucky enough to benefit from. I can recommend Campbell’s work without qualification. In fact you’d be mad not to use his services.”
